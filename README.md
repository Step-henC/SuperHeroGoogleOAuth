# SuperHeroGoogleOAuth

This was an initial attempt to perform google authentication for the Super Hero CRUD API project. The google authentication in the project would have been performed with Golang. 
However, the Super Hero CRUD API, supported by C#, is attached to an Angular front end, as well as a PHP front end. With PHP already being a server side language, connected to Golang would have been redundant. 
In response, google oauth was done in PHP successfully in a separate project.
